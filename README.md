# braidTool-2.0
This is a maya autodesk tool that facilitates creating braids for groom purposes that can later be used for tube grooming as well.
*IMPORTANT* Make sure to run the script twice as some of the window sliders for clumpTwist and clumpWidth only activate this way.
The History should retain all the way even after using the curvesExtruder script (not mine) to play even more the final look.
Also the hairsystem is active with the follicles created from your curve.
Have fun and play around with it.
